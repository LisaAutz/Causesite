			<p class="sampleCase">
				A woman , she will remain unamed (your confidentiality is enormously important to us), contacted T.o.M via our convenient online questionaire (which took her 15 hours to complete, despite aformentioned convenience). It was immediately clear from her quite frankly off the charts results that something here was deeply ammiss. I scheduled an appointment with my troubled client immediately. She arrived four hours late to this intake appointment 
				(needless to say she was billed a cancelation fee - we are extremely busy here at T.o.M.). She rescheduled her appointment again, missed it again and again rescheduled 
				(please note, we have since changed our policy and decline to reschedules or cancelations regardless of cirumcstance).When my client finally arrived, 5 hours late, to her third-time rescheduled intake appointment to find our office already closed for the day, she flew into a terrific rage that T.o.M. hadn't remianed open for her. Her rage was on the level of horrifying. </p>

			<p class="sampleCaseTwo">
				Luckily, I was already on the case, and lurking around the corner. It was crystal clear to me, before even meeting my client, what I was dealing with. My unidentified client was suffering from a total lack of comprehension that her personal disregard for scheduled time manifested as a total disregard for the time of other people, many of whom value said time and structure deeply. Her T.o.M. in short was suffering from a massively solipsistic handycap. It came as little surprise that she lived alone with 10 cats and that her interpersonals (as we call them at T.o.M.) had reached code red levels. But NOT TO FEAR! LOOK NO FURTHER! 
				At T.o.M. we helped her to understand the following simplicity: If she could not understand the value of time to her fellow humanity, and she refused (as the case revelealed) to at least, out of curtesy, show up to an appointment at an appointed time, than the simplist solution would be for her to cease making plans all together. We are happy to report, at this time, that our unidentified client (via email testiomony from home) has informed us that she is feeling happier -- and more conflict free -- than ever!  And this after years of failed therapy and so on...
